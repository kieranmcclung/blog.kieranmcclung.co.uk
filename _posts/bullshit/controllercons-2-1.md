seoDescription: Controllercons 2.1 update includes a nice new website, better documentation, and easier-to-use SVGs
---

Controllercons is a project that I created 3 or 4 years ago, and it's one that I recently updated.

The site looked a bit aged, so I've given it a modern makeover. Of course, this was supposed to be a quick couple of days' work, but it spiralled into a couple of months...

Still! The result is a much-improved website with better documentation and easier-to-use SVGs. It's a win for everyone!

Controllercons are completely free to use, so why not check them out?!
