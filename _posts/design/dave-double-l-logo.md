Dave Double L is an up-and-coming Twitch streamer and he's also my friend 😘 _You can check him out here on [Twitch.tv/davedoublel](https://www.twitch.tv/davedoublel)_

The logo needed to be clean, readable but also retain some of the sci-fi aesthetic that streamers tend to steer towards. Using a purple palette is a nod to Twitch but the logo can be flexible with the use of photography to add a bit of texture.

The bold impression of the logo also lends itself nicely to potential merchandise ideas further down the line.
