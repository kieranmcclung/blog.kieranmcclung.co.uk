seoDescription: Thoughts on the fascist riots currently ravaging the UK
---

I’m not alone in writing this, but I’m exhausted. The continuing riots from fascists across the country are terrifying; burning hotels barricaded to keep the supposed 'refugees shipped over here' from escaping, traffic stops to prevent non-white drivers from passing through, and lynch mobs seeking out people of colour and beating them senseless. It reads like something out of a dystopian novel, but this is happening right now in the UK.

Overseas, authorities are advising people not to visit the country. High-profile right-wing social media accounts are branding these riots as "inevitable" and praising the attempt to "take back their country". The thing is, this isn’t the UK. It’s pockets of easily-led racist thugs following the directives of slightly more intelligent racists who have laid the groundwork to profit from their prejudices. It’s infuriating. Please don't misread this as me showing empathy towards these blights on humanity. This puppetry doesn’t apply to everyone, and it certainly doesn't excuse their actions at all. Every single person involved in these riots needs severe punishment.

I’ve scrolled through Twitter over the last few days and felt nothing but anger and sadness. That's easy for me to say from the comfort of my home, and it pales in comparison to those being targeted in these riots, but I feel useless sitting here absorbing all the horrendous footage. Endless waves of videos showcasing the worst parts of our country. What honestly can be done to eradicate such deep-seated hatred? There's hope that this will die out generationally, but then you catch a video of children chanting hateful speech whilst their parents torch a library. It feels hopeless.

However, through all the horror, there have been gems of what makes the country great. And while I'm far from patriotic, this is who the UK is. A multicultural and caring society; videos of people standing up to the rioting gangs, Muslim communities on the frontline offering care and safe refuge to those who're trying to protect others. And while that rage conjured up by the ignorant, loathsome, scum who are out there terrorising our country is still bubbling in my stomach, there’s comfort in knowing that the good people out there outweigh the bad. And once the actions of these hate groups are dealt with, it needs to be made known that this isn't and should never be tolerated.
