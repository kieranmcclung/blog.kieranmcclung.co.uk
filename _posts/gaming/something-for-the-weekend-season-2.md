All four episodes of "Season 2" of Something for the Weekend are out now!

Something for the Weekend is a series of video games that showcases short games that you can play over a weekend. The idea, although not particularly original, stemmed from me having kids and not much time to play games. Each episode shows two games with a relatively short completion time. Not only that, but they're games that I think are good, but your mileage may vary!
